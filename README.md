The housing market is subject to constant fluctuations, and predicting the changes in house prices and rental rates is a challenge that many individuals and investors face. The lack of reliable means to estimate and predict these prices could result in uninformed decisions, financial risks, and missed opportunities. 

Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the real estate industry, further complicating the prediction of future housing prices and rental rates.

To address this problem, we developed a forecasting model employing ML algorithms such as ARIMA and SARIMA. Our models considered various factors that affected house prices and rental rates, such as economic indicators, demographic trends, interest rates, and market supply and demand. Our model used machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data, identify patterns, and predict future trends in the housing market. 

For this forecasting project, we utilized the Housing Value and Rental Dataset from Zillow's Research Dataset Website. The dataset is available at https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ and contains a range of valuable features, including RegionID, SizeRank, RegionName, RegionType, StateName, State, City, Metro, and CountyName. 

These features provide a comprehensive view of the housing market across various regions, enabling us to analyze and forecast trends at different levels of granularity. By leveraging this dataset, we were able to build robust and accurate forecasting models that can help individuals and investors make informed decisions in the real estate market.
